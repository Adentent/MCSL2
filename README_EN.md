This is a remake of [MCSL](https://github.com/LxHTT/MCSL).

At first the whole project would be developed with C#.
Becuz of little knowledge of C#, it was turned to Python.

MCSL 2 has redesigned the user interface, develop with cleaner code logic.
In addition to Launch, Config, and Download, many extension tools have been added to MCSL 2.
You can preview the UI of MCSL 2 [here](https://mcsl.netlify.app/preview).

Please report the bugs by [Issues](https://github.com/LxHTT/MCSL2/issues) to make MCSL 2 better.
