This is a remake of my old project [MCSL](https://github.com/LxHTT/MCSL).

At first I prefer developing with C#, but it seems that I don't have enough knowledge of it.  ~~SO FOOL~~  So I turned to Python again.

The official website of MCSL 2：[https://mcsl.netlify.app](https://mcsl.netlify.app)

The official website of MCSL 2 API：[https://whdlx.gitee.io/mcslapi](https://whdlx.gitee.io/mcslapi)

(In China, you may need to use a web acceleration tool for GitHub, such as Watt Toolkit.)

MCSL 2 has redesigned the user interface, develop with cleaner code logic. In addition to Launch, Configuration, and Download, many extension tools have been added to MCSL 2.
You can preview the UI of MCSL 2 [here](https://mcsl.netlify.app/preview).

Please report the bugs of my program to make MCSL 2 better.

(Use GitHub Issues to report PLZ)

My Email is here:  lxhtz.dl@qq.com . You can contact me as long as you need help.

The software is released under the GPLv3 open source license.
